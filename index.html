      <h1> BUS MALL MARKET SURVEY </h1>
      <p> Welcome to the Bus Mall market survey. Bus Mall is dedicated to providing its captive audience with the best products out there... not to mention the best value-based pricing! By taking the following survey, you allow us to optimize both of these parameters.</p>
      <h2> Instructions </h2>
      <p> Take a look at the images below. Click on the one you find most appealing. The images will then reload. When they do, pick your favorite out of that set, too. We ask that you pick your favorite image out of the three displayed images, for a total of 25 times. Once you have completed this task, you can click the button "See Results" to see a chart showing the total clicks for each BusMall product, followed by another chart showing the ratio of clicks per view for each BusMall product. We thank you for your help. You can click the button "Run Survey Again" to start the survey over. </p>
