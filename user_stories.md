#BUS_MALL Project
##Use Cases

As a Developer, I want to:
* Make code that is dry, so my code is efficient.
* Make code that is readable, so that it is accessible to other developers and potential teammates.
* Make code that is scalable, in case the client wants to modify its image bank or add to its list of potential products.
* Produce a webpage that will be visually appealing, user friendly, and bug free, so that the survey takers have no issues taking the survey.
* Display the market data in a clear and user friendly way, so that the marketing team can analyze it effectively.

As a Marketer, I want to:
* Collect data from a variety of potential users, so I can get a good idea of the products my target market would purchase.
* Be able to access the market data in a clear, easy way, so I can interpret that data accurately.
* Be able to add new images or change the existing images being presented to the survey takers, so I can adapt to new product seasons and test new potential products.
* Show survey takers each product at least once, and have them compare each product to each other product, so I have a global sense of which products would be the most successful.

As a Survey Taker, I want to:
* Be presented with a straightforward UI, so I don't have to worry about how to take the test.
* Get an alert message when I click near an image, instead of on that image, so I know whether my votes are being accurately tallied.
* Know when the survey is complete, so I don't get stuck clicking images forever/
* See the total test results, because I am probably curious about how my personal preferences compare to the preferences of others.  

##README

I worked closely with Lee, Adrian, Sera, and Britt on this project, particularly on getting the display count and the vote count to start adding up.

Then, once I burned my code to the ground, I had a lot more help from Lee, Maelle, and Britt.
